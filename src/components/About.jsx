        This project showcases a unique way of managing and presenting my Shells
        fuel receipts. The receipts are parsed using JavaScript and processed
        via Google App Script to populate a Google Sheet. The Google Sheet is
        then published as a CSV file and integrated into this application. Every
        time the spreadsheet updates, the application reflects the changes in
        real-time. This seamless connection demonstrates the power of
        JavaScript, Google App Script, and modern web development practices.

        Personal Story
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        I started collecting my receipts while I was trucking and managing my
        own taxes. Leasing my truck felt like running my own business, and
        keeping track of every receipt was essential. Eventually, I took a break
        and attended Coding Dojo, where I had the idea of using my email data
        for a project but lacked the skills to extract it. After years of
        learning and gaining experience, I am thrilled to present this project,
        which brings my idea to life. Itâ€™s a testament to persistence and
        growth. I hope you enjoy exploring it!
